=head2 GObject

To deal with the intricate interaction of the different reference-counting
semantics of Perl objects versus GObjects, the bindings create a combined
PerlObject+GObject, with the GObject's pointer in magic attached to the Perl
object, and the Perl object's pointer in the GObject's user data.  Thus it's
not really a "wrapper", but we refer to it as one, because "combined Perl
object + GObject" is a cumbersome and confusing mouthful.

GObjects are represented as blessed hash references.  The GObject user data
mechanism is not typesafe, and thus is used only for unsigned integer values;
the Perl-level hash is available for any type of user data.  The combined
nature of the wrapper means that data stored in the hash will stick around as
long as the object is alive.

Since the C pointer is stored in attached magic, the C pointer is not available
to the Perl developer via the hash object, so there's no need to worry about
breaking it from perl.

Propers go to Marc Lehmann for dreaming most of this up.

=item void gperl_register_sink_func (GType gtype, GPerlObjectSinkFunc func)

Tell gperl_new_object() to use I<func> to claim ownership of objects derived
from I<gtype>.

gperl_new_object() always refs a GObject when wrapping it for the first time.
To have the Perl wrapper claim ownership of a GObject as part of
gperl_new_object(), you unref the object after ref'ing it. however, different
GObject subclasses have different ways to claim ownership; for example,
GtkObject simply requires you to call gtk_object_sink().  To make this concept
generic, this function allows you to register a function to be called when then
wrapper should claim ownership of the object.  The I<func> registered for a
given I<type> will be called on any object for which C<< g_type_isa
(G_TYPE_OBJECT (object), type) >> succeeds.

If no sinkfunc is found for an object, g_object_unref() will be used.

Even though GObjects don't need sink funcs, we need to have them in Glib
as a hook for upstream objects.  If we create a GtkObject (or any
other type of object which uses a different way to claim ownership) via
Glib::Object->new, any upstream wrappers, such as gtk2perl_new_object(), will
B<not> be called.  Having a sink func facility down here enables us always to
do the right thing.

=item void gperl_object_set_no_warn_unreg_subclass (GType gtype, gboolean nowarn)

In versions 1.00 through 1.10x of Glib, the bindings required all types
to be registered ahead of time.  Upon encountering an unknown type, the
bindings would emit a warning to the effect of "unknown type 'Foo';
representing as first known parent type 'Bar'".  However, for some
types, such as GtkStyle or GdkGC, the actual object returned is an
instance of a child type of a private implementation (e.g., a theme
engine ("BlueCurveStyle") or gdk backend ("GdkGCX11")); we neither can
nor should have registered names for these types.  Therefore, it is
possible to tell the bindings not to warn about these unregistered
subclasses, and simply represent them as the parent type.

With 1.12x, the bindings will automatically register unknown classes
into the namespace Glib::Object::_Unregistered to avoid possible
breakage resulting from unknown ancestors of known children.  To
preserve the old registered-as-unregistered behavior, the value
installed by this function is used to prevent the _Unregistered mapping
for such private backend classes.


Note: this assumes I<gtype> has already been registered with
gperl_register_object().

=item SV * gperl_new_object (GObject * object, gboolean own)

Use this function to get the perl part of a GObject.  If I<object>
has never been seen by perl before, a new, empty perl object will
be created and added to a private key under I<object>'s qdata.  If
I<object> already has a perl part, a new reference to it will be
created. The gobject + perl object together form a combined object that
is properly refcounted, i.e. both parts will stay alive as long as at
least one of them is alive, and only when both perl object and gobject are
no longer referenced will both be freed.

The perl object will be blessed into the package corresponding to the GType
returned by calling G_OBJECT_TYPE() on I<object>; if that class has not
been registered via gperl_register_object(), this function will emit a
warning to that effect (with warn()), and attempt to bless it into the
first known class in the object's ancestry.  Since Glib::Object is
already registered, you'll get a Glib::Object if you are lazy, and thus
this function can fail only if I<object> isn't descended from GObject,
in which case it croaks.  (In reality, if you pass a non-GObject to this
function, you'll be lucky if you don't get a segfault, as there's not
really a way to trap that.)  In practice these warnings can be unavoidable,
so you can use gperl_object_set_no_warn_unreg_subclass() to quell them
on a class-by-class basis.

However, when perl code is calling a GObject constructor (any function
which returns a new GObject), call gperl_new_object() with I<own> set to
%TRUE; this will cause the first matching sink function to be called
on the GObject to claim ownership of that object, so that it will be
destroyed when the perl object goes out of scope. The default sink func
is g_object_unref(); other types should supply the proper function;
e.g., GtkObject should use gtk_object_sink() here.

Returns the blessed perl object, or #&PL_sv_undef if object was #NULL.

=for position DESCRIPTION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GObject is the base object class provided by the gobject library.  It provides
object properties with a notification system, and emittable signals.

Glib::Object is the corresponding Perl object class.  Glib::Objects are
represented by blessed hash references, with a magical connection to the
underlying C object.

=head2 get and set

Some subclasses of C<Glib::Object> override C<get> and C<set> with methods
more useful to the subclass, for example C<Gtk2::TreeModel> getting and
setting row contents.

This is usually done when the subclass has no object properties.  Any object
properties it or a further subclass does have can always be accessed with
C<get_property> and C<set_property> (together with C<find_property> and
C<list_properties> to enquire about them).

Generic code for any object subclass can use the names C<get_property> and
C<set_property> to be sure of getting the object properties as such.

GObject provides an arbitrary data mechanism that assigns unsigned integers
to key names.  Functionality overlaps with the hash used as the Perl object
instance, so we strongly recommend you use hash keys for your data storage.
The GObject data values cannot store type information, so they are not safe
to use for anything but integer values, and you really should use this method
only if you know what you are doing.

=for arg pointer (unsigned) a C pointer value as an integer.

=for arg noinc (boolean) if true, do not increase the GObject's reference count when creating the Perl wrapper.  this typically means that when the Perl wrapper will own the object.  in general you don't want to do that, so the default is false.

Create a Perl Glib::Object reference for the C object pointed to by I<$pointer>.
You should need this I<very> rarely; it's intended to support foreign objects.

NOTE: the cast from arbitrary integer to GObject may result in a core dump without
warning, because the type-checking macro G_OBJECT() attempts to dereference the
pointer to find a GTypeClass structure, and there is no portable way to validate
the pointer.

=for arg all if FALSE (or omitted) tie only properties for this object's class, if TRUE tie the properties of this and all parent classes.

A special method available to Glib::Object derivatives, it uses perl's tie
facilities to associate hash keys with the properties of the object. For
example:

  $button->tie_properties;
  # equivilent to $button->set (label => 'Hello World');
  $button->{label} = 'Hello World';
  print "the label is: ".$button->{label}."\n";

Attempts to write to read-only properties will croak, reading a write-only
property will return '[write-only]'.

Care must be taken when using tie_properties with objects of types created with
Glib::Object::Subclass as there may be clashes with existing hash keys that
could cause infinite loops. The solution is to use custom property get/set
functions to alter the storage locations of the properties.
