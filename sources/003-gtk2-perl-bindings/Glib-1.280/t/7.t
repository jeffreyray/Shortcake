test some GSignal stuff - marshaling, exception trapping, order of operations.

based on the Glib::Object::Subclass, since it already worked, but not
in that test because it would confound too many issues.

we do not use Test::More or even Test::Simple because we need to test
order of execution...  the ok() funcs from those modules assume you
are doing all your tests in order, but our stuff will jump around.


my apologies for the extreme density and ugliness of this code.
