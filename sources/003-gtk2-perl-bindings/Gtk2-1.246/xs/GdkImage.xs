=for position DESCRIPTION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Gtk2::Gdk::Image> is a 2-D array of pixel values in client-side
memory.  It can optionally use shared memory with the X server for
fast copying to or from a window or pixmap.

If you're thinking of using this then look at C<Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf>
first.  GdkPixbuf has many more features, in particular file read and
write (PNG, JPEG, etc).  But a GdkImage lets you work directly in
pixel values instead of expanding to RGB components.

See L<Gtk2::Gdk::Drawable> for C<draw_image>, C<get_image> and
C<copy_to_image> methods to draw or fetch images to or from a window
or pixmap.

The various C<get> methods are Gtk 2.22 style.  For previous versions
they're direct field access.

## This looks like a perfectly good function, and a good way to get

Return a copy of the raw pixel data memory from C<$image>.  This is
C<bytes_per_line * height> many bytes.
=cut
## This is a copy similar to the way C<Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf> C<get_pixels>
## copies.  Perhaps in the future some sort of C<get_pixels_substr> could
## get just part of it, or C<put_bytes> or 4-arg substr write to part of it,
## as an alternative to individual C<get_pixel> / C<put_pixel>.
##
## A magic sv which could be read and written to modify the image data
## might be cute, but is probably more trouble than its worth.  substr
## fetch/store funcs would make it clearer what's being done.
##
## If a magic scalar held a reference then there's a gremlin in Perl
## 5.10 lvalue C<substr> where such an sv gets kept alive in the
## function scratchpad, risking the underlying GdkImage kept alive
## longer than it should be.  Or if it didn't hold a reference you'd
## have to rely on the application to keep the GdkImage alive while
## the raw memory was being manipulated.
