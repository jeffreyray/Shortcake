=for apidoc Gtk2::VScrollBar::new

A typo in days long past resulted in the package names for Gtk2::VScrollbar
and Gtk2::HScrollbar being misspelled with a capital C<B>, despite the fact
that only the proper name (with the small C<b>) was actually registered
with the Glib type system.  For backward compatibility with Gtk2-1.00,
Gtk2::VScrollBar->new calls Gtk2::VScrollbar->new without complaint.
