=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gtk2::ListItem is the widget used for each item in a Gtk2::List.  Gtk2::List
and Gtk2::ListItem are deprecated; use Gtk2::TreeView and a Gtk2::ListStore
instead.

Gtk2::ListItem is included in Gtk2-Perl only because Gtk2::Combo contains a
Gtk2::List, and Gtk2::Combo's replacement, Gtk2::ComboBox, didn't appear in
gtk+ until 2.4.0.
