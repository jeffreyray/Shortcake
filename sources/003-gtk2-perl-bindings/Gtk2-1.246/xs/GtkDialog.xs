=for position DESCRIPTION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dialog boxes are a convenient way to prompt the user for a small amount of
input, eg. to display a message, ask a question, or anything else that does not
require extensive effort on the user's part. 

GTK+ treats a dialog as a window split vertically. The top section is a
Gtk2::VBox, and is where widgets such as a Gtk2::Label or a Gtk2::Entry should
be packed. The bottom area is known as the "action_area". This is generally
used for packing buttons into the dialog which may perform functions such as
cancel, ok, or apply.  The two areas are separated by a Gtk2::HSeparator. 

GtkDialog boxes are created with a call to C<< Gtk2::Dialog->new >>.  The
multi-argument form (and its alias, C<new_with_buttons> is recommended; it
allows you to set the dialog title, some convenient flags, and add simple
buttons all in one go.

If I<$dialog> is a newly created dialog, the two primary areas of the window
can be accessed as C<< $dialog->get_content_area () >> and
C<< $dialog->get_action_area () >>, as can be seen from the example, below.

A 'modal' dialog (that is, one which freezes the rest of the application from
user input), can be created by calling the Gtk2::Window method C<set_modal> on
the dialog.  You can also pass the 'modal' flag to C<new>.

If you add buttons to GtkDialog using C<new>, C<new_with_buttons>,
C<add_button>, C<add_buttons>, or C<add_action_widget>, clicking the button
will emit a signal called "response" with a response ID that you specified.
GTK+ will never assign a meaning to positive response IDs; these are entirely
user-defined.  But for convenience, you can use the response IDs in the
Gtk2::ResponseType enumeration.  If a dialog receives a delete event, the
"response" signal will be emitted with a response ID of 'delete-event'.

If you want to block waiting for a dialog to return before returning control
flow to your code, you can call C<< $dialog->run >>.  This function enters a
recursive main loop and waits for the user to respond to the dialog, returning
the  response ID corresponding to the button the user clicked. 

For the simple dialog in the following example, in reality you'd probably use
Gtk2::MessageDialog to save yourself some effort.  But you'd need to create the
dialog contents manually if you had more than a simple message in the dialog. 

 # Function to open a dialog box displaying the message provided.
 
 sub quick_message {
    my $message = shift;
    my $dialog = Gtk2::Dialog->new ('Message', $main_app_window,
                                    'destroy-with-parent',
                                    'gtk-ok' => 'none');
    my $label = Gtk2::Label->new (message);
    $dialog->get_content_area ()->add ($label);

    # Ensure that the dialog box is destroyed when the user responds.
    $dialog->signal_connect (response => sub { $_[0]->destroy });

    $dialog->show_all;
 }

=head2 Delete, Close and Destroy

In the default keybindings the "Esc" key calls the C<close> action
signal.  The default in that signal is to synthesise a C<delete-event>
like a window manager close would do.

A delete-event first runs the C<response> signal with ID
C<"delete-event">, but the handler there can't influence the default
destroy behaviour of the C<delete-event> signal.  See L<Gtk2::Window>
for notes on destroy vs hide.

If you add your own "Close" button to the dialog, perhaps using the
builtin C<close> response ID, you must make your C<response> signal
handler do whatever's needed for closing.  Often a good thing is just
to run the C<close> action signal the same as the Esc key.

    sub my_response_handler {
      my ($dialog, $response) = @_;
      if ($response eq 'close') {
        $self->signal_emit ('close');

      } elsif ...
    }

=cut

=for position post_signals

Note that currently in a Perl subclass of C<Gtk2::Dialog> a class
closure, ie. class default signal handler, for the C<response> signal
will be called with the response ID just as an integer, it's not
turned into an enum string like C<"ok"> the way a handler setup with
C<signal_connect> receives.

Hopefully this will change in the future, so don't count on it.  In
the interim the easiest thing to do is install your default handler in
C<INIT_INSTANCE> with a C<signal_connect>.  (The subtleties of what
order handlers are called in will differ, but often that doesn't
matter.)

=cut

=for enum GtkResponseType

The response type is somewhat abnormal as far as gtk2-perl enums go.  In C,
this enum lists named, predefined integer values for a field that is other
composed of whatever integer values you like.  In Perl, we allow this to
be either one of the string constants listed here or any positive integer
value.  For example, 'ok', 'cancel', 4, and 42 are all valid response ids.
You cannot use arbitrary string values, they must be integers.  Be careful,
because unknown string values tend to be mapped to 0.

=for apidoc
=for signature $responsetype = $dialog->run
Blocks in a recursive main loop until the dialog either emits the response
signal, or is destroyed.  If the dialog is destroyed during the call to
C<< $dialog->run >>, the function returns 'GTK_RESPONSE_NONE' ('none').
Otherwise, it returns the response ID from the "response" signal emission.
Before entering the recursive main loop, C<< $dialog->run >> calls
C<< $widget->show >> on I<$dialog> for you. Note that you still need to show
any children of the dialog yourself. 

During C<run>, the default behavior of "delete_event" is disabled; if the
dialog receives "delete_event", it will not be destroyed as windows usually
are, and C<run> will return 'delete-event'.
Also, during C<run> the dialog will be modal.  You can force C<run> to return
at any time by calling C<< $dialog->response >> to emit the "response" signal.
Destroying the dialog during C<run> is a very bad idea, because your post-run
code won't know whether the dialog was destroyed or not. 

After C<run> returns, you are responsible for hiding or destroying the dialog
if you wish to do so. 

Typical usage of this function might be: 

  if ('accept' eq $dialog->run) {
         do_application_specific_something ();
  } else {
         do_nothing_since_dialog_was_cancelled ();
  }
  $dialog->destroy;
